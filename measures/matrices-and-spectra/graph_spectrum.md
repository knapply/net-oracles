# Graph spectrum {#concept-top}

Family: [Matrices and spectra](index.html). Subfamily: Spectra. Concept id: `graph_spectrum`. 1 measure.

## Notation {#concept-notation}

<div class="table-wrapper"><table class="notation"><thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\(G=(V,E)\)</td><td>graph with node set \(V\) and edge set \(E\); every edge has a source and a target (the two ends of an undirected edge are interchangeable)</td></tr><tr><td>\(n=|V|\)</td><td>number of nodes</td></tr><tr><td>\(m=|E|\)</td><td>number of edges</td></tr><tr><td>\(M\)</td><td>a graph matrix (adjacency, Laplacian, normalized Laplacian)</td></tr><tr><td>\(\lambda_1\ge\cdots\ge\lambda_n\)</td><td>eigenvalues of \(M\) with multiplicity</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

## Definition {#concept-definition}

Graph spectrum. Entries grouped here: Graph spectrum (eigenvalues of a graph matrix).

<div class="formula-block"><p class="formula-name"><strong>Spectrum of a graph (Biggs 1974; Chung 1997)</strong> <span class="applies">applies to: undirected</span></p><div class="formula">\[\operatorname{spec}(G)=\{\lambda:\ \det(M-\lambda I)=0\}\ \text{with multiplicities},\quad \sum_i\lambda_i=\operatorname{tr}M\]</div><p class="formula-where">The multiset of eigenvalues of the chosen matrix; real for a symmetric \(M\). Which matrix is meant (adjacency spectrum, Laplacian spectrum, normalized-Laplacian spectrum) changes the result completely.</p></div>
