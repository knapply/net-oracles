# Approximate node connectivity {#concept-top}

Family: [Components and connectivity](index.html). Subfamily: Connectivity numbers. Concept id: `node_connectivity`. 1 measure.

## Notation {#concept-notation}

<div class="table-wrapper"><table class="notation"><thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\(G=(V,E)\)</td><td>graph with node set \(V\), \(n=|V|\), \(m=|E|\); every edge has a source and a target (the ends of an undirected edge are interchangeable)</td></tr><tr><td>\(\kappa(G)\)</td><td>node connectivity: the fewest nodes whose removal disconnects \(G\), or \(n-1\) for a complete graph (Whitney 1932)</td></tr><tr><td>\(\tilde\kappa(G)\)</td><td>the greedy lower bound</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

## Definition {#concept-definition}

Approximate node connectivity of the whole network by greedy node-disjoint shortest paths.

<div class="formula-block"><p class="formula-name"><strong>Node connectivity (Whitney 1932)</strong> <span class="applies">applies to: undirected</span></p><div class="formula">\[\kappa(G)=\min_{s,t\text{ non-adjacent}}\kappa(s,t)\qquad(\kappa(K_n)=n-1)\]</div><p class="formula-where">Menger's theorem equates \(\kappa(s,t)\) with the maximum number of internally node-disjoint \(s\)-\(t\) paths.</p></div>

<div class="formula-block"><p class="formula-name"><strong>Approximation (White and Newman 2001)</strong> <span class="applies">applies to: undirected</span></p><div class="formula">\[\tilde\kappa(s,t)=\#\text{paths found by repeatedly taking a shortest }s\text{-}t\text{ path and deleting its inner nodes}\]</div><p class="formula-where">A lower bound \(\tilde\kappa(s,t)\le\kappa(s,t)\) obtained greedily; the graph value is the minimum over pairs (or over the sampled pairs), so it is an upper-bounded estimate and not exact. The result depends on which shortest path is chosen at each step.</p></div>

Measure id: `ap_node_connectivity`. Original family: Graph theory and combinatorics.

**Definition.** Approximate node connectivity of the whole network by greedy node-disjoint shortest paths.

**Conventions and tolerances.** Tolerance is the bound used when comparing a tool's values with the reference value: `abs` and `rel` (0 means exact).
