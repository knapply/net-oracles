# Connected dominating set {#concept-top}

Family: [Graph theory and combinatorics](index.html). Subfamily: Covers and dominating sets. Concept id: `connected_dominating_set`. 1 measure.

## Notation {#concept-notation}

<div class="table-wrapper"><table class="notation"><thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\(G=(V,E)\)</td><td>graph with node set \(V\) and edge set \(E\); every edge has a source and a target (the two ends of an undirected edge are interchangeable)</td></tr><tr><td>\(n=|V|\)</td><td>number of nodes</td></tr><tr><td>\(m=|E|\)</td><td>number of edges</td></tr><tr><td>\(D\)</td><td>dominating set</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

## Definition {#concept-definition}

Connected dominating set. Entries grouped here: Cds.

<div class="formula-block"><p class="formula-name"><strong>Connected dominating set (Guha and Khuller 1998)</strong> <span class="applies">applies to: undirected</span></p><div class="formula">\[D\subseteq V:\ \forall v\notin D\ \exists u\in D,\ uv\in E\ \ \text{and}\ \ G[D]\ \text{connected}\]</div><p class="formula-where">A dominating set that induces a connected subgraph; defined only for a connected graph. Minimum size is NP-hard; the cited paper gives logarithmic-factor approximations.</p></div>

## Cds {#st_cds}

Measure id: `st_cds`. Original family: Graph theory and combinatorics.

**Definition.** Cds.

**Implementations**

<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Tool</th><th>State</th><th>Why, if not agrees</th><th>API names</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="../../tools/networkx.html">NetworkX</a></td><td><a class="st st-t st-ok" href="../../method.html#state-checked-agrees"><span class="g" aria-hidden="true">✓</span>checked, agrees</a></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

**Conventions and tolerances.** Tolerance is the bound used when comparing a tool's values with the reference value: `abs` and `rel` (0 means exact).

<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Variant</th><th>Tool</th><th>Scope</th><th>Outcome</th><th>Differs when</th><th>Conventions</th><th>Tolerance</th><th>Call</th><th>Note</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>st_cds</code></td><td>NetworkX</td><td>undirected</td><td>agrees</td><td></td><td></td><td>abs 0, rel 0</td><td><code>sorted(nx.connected_dominating_set(G_sorted)) (-1 if disconnected)</code></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
