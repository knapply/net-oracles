**Conventions and tolerances.** Tolerance is the bound used when comparing a tool's values with the reference value: `abs` and `rel` (0 means exact).

| Variant | Tool | Scope | Outcome | Differs when | Conventions | Tolerance | Call | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `construct_intersection` | NetworkX | any | agrees |  |  | abs 0, rel 0 | `nx.intersection(G, H) edges` |  |
