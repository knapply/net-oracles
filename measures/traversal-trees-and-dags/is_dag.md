**Conventions and tolerances.** Tolerance is the bound used when comparing a tool's values with the reference value: `abs` and `rel` (0 means exact).

| Variant | Tool | Scope | Outcome | Differs when | Conventions | Tolerance | Call | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dag_is_dag` | NetworkX | any | agrees |  |  | abs 0, rel 0 | `nx.is_directed_acyclic_graph(M)` |  |
| `dag_is_dag` | rustworkx | any | no-value-on-some-inputs | (no value) undirected | direction | abs 0, rel 0 | `rx.is_directed_acyclic_graph(G)` | rx.is\_directed\_acyclic\_graph() accepts only a PyDiGraph. |
